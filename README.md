# üß† DeepResearcher Architecture Overview

The **DeepResearcher** solution is an AI-powered research system designed to perform comprehensive, multi-step research based on user queries. Below is a detailed breakdown of its architecture.

---

## üß© Core Components

### 1. `ResearchOrchestrator`
Manages the entire research workflow from initial query to final answer generation:
- Coordinates multi-stage research
- Maintains state across the research lifecycle
- Interfaces with AI functions at each stage
- Transforms and routes data between stages

### 2. `TavilyConnector`
Integrates with the Tavily web search API:
- Fetches factual data from the internet
- Returns structured search results with source URLs

### 3. `ResearchService`
The API layer that:
- Manages research sessions
- Exposes endpoints for client apps
- Handles asynchronous research flows
- Uses in-memory cache for session state

### 4. `ResearchCache`
A semantic caching layer that:
- Stores previous research outputs
- Detects semantically similar queries
- Prevents redundant processing

### 5. `Semantic Kernel Integration`
The AI reasoning engine that:
- Powers the research pipeline with specialized functions
- Understands and processes natural language
- Executes complex reasoning tasks

## üîå Plugin Functions

Each research stage is powered by a dedicated AI function:

| Function       | Role                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Clarifier`    | Detects ambiguity and generates clarifying questions                 |
| `Decomposer`   | Breaks down topics into manageable subtasks                          |
| `Summarizer`   | Summarizes findings for each subtask                                 |
| `Combiner`     | Synthesizes all research into a coherent answer                      |
| `Reviewer`     | Identifies gaps and accuracy issues                                  |
| `MiniCombiner` | Merges follow-up research with existing content                      |

## üîÑ Data Flow & Process Stages

The research pipeline follows these stages:

1. **Initialization**
   - Create session
   - Check cache
   - Set up research context

2. **Clarification**
   - Analyze query
   - Generate clarifying questions
   - Refine prompts

3. **Decomposition**
   - Plan research
   - Create subtasks

4. **Research Execution**
   - Perform parallel web searches
   - Gather and structure information

5. **Synthesis**
   - Combine summaries
   - Draft coherent content

6. **Review & Refinement**
   - Identify gaps
   - Conduct follow-up research
   - Validate quality

7. **Finalization**
   - Integrate citations
   - Polish content
   - Format references

## üß† State Management

The system tracks state across multiple dimensions:
- **Session State**: Overall progress
- **Research Phase**: Current stage
- **Subtasks**: Individual research units
- **Content State**: Drafts and final answers
- **Sources**: Reference URLs
- **Messages**: Logs and status updates

---

## üì° Communication Pattern

- **Asynchronous Processing**: For long-running tasks
- **Progress Callbacks**: Real-time updates
- **JSON Serialization**: Structured data exchange
- **RESTful API**: Client interaction

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Resilience

- **Retry Logic**: For transient failures
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternate strategies
- **Exception Handling**: Structured error management
- **Robust JSON Parsing**: For AI-generated content

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Technical Stack

- `.NET 8`: Runtime platform
- `Semantic Kernel`: AI reasoning framework
- `MemoryCache`: Session storage
- `ASP.NET Core`: Web API framework
- `System.Text.Json`: Serialization
- `Task-based Async Pattern`: Non-blocking operations

---

This architecture enables a powerful AI research system that blends web search with advanced reasoning to deliver structured, citation-rich research outputs.
