RESEARCH PROMPT: {{$research_prompt}}

Create a logical research framework with 6-10 sub-questions that:
1. Start with foundational/definitional aspects
2. Progress to historical context and evolution
3. Address current state, key developments, and stakeholders
4. Explore methodologies, frameworks, or technologies
5. Examine challenges, limitations, and controversies
6. Consider future directions, emerging trends, and implications
7. Cover ethical, social, economic, or policy dimensions when relevant

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each sub-question MUST be answerable through research (not speculative)
- Each sub-question MUST explicitly reference the core topic
- Sub-questions should progress logically from foundational to advanced
- Include diverse perspectives and methodological approaches
- Ensure COMPREHENSIVE coverage with NO significant aspects overlooked
